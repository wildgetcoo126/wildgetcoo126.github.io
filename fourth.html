	<td><img src=yogurt.png width=500 height=500>Yogurt is a basic yet healthy snack. Yogurt is highly nutritious. It is an excellent source of protein, calcium and potassium. All you have to do is go to your local market, and pick up any yogurt. The best part is that you can add fruits and grains to it to make it taste better. Blueberries, strawberries, graham crackers, you can add any healthy foods and make a snack that will not only taste good, but also be nutritionally good for you.</td>

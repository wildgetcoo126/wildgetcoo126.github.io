<p>My name is Valery Olshansky, the creator of dieting. I go to brookyln studios secondary school, and i am a cte student. I made this website because for kids like me, getting in shape could be hard. Unless you are a super athlete, then most kids aren’t in the shape they could be. Most of them like me, love video games, watching anime, going on our phones, we don’t like to go outside and that causes people to lose shape. dieting is suppose to help kids like that or people that need to lose weight, find foods and meals that you can eat and gain a hefty amount of nutrition in the process. Hopefully you can find something useful in this website and you can find a good meal or food that you will end up loving and eat for the rest of your healthy live.</p>
